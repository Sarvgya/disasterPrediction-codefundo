# disasterPrediction-codefundo

AIM:
To build a technology that will help to prevent and predict the impact of Natural disasters like Earthquakes and Floods (These two areas will be our primary concern).

IDEA:
We will try to make an App using Android Studio which will work in colloboration with Machine Learning to make people aware of the disasters in the near future.
This will work in the following way:-
  1)	The App will detect the user's current Location.
  2)	Using this information we can get useful DATA from the various databases available.
  3)	The Data will include the following things:-
		   - It's past records on any disasters (Earthquakes and Floods).
		   - Satellite Imaging of that particular location.
  4)	Using various ML algorthims we will try to predict the disaster and notify the users.
  5)	For more accuracy we will provide a warning to the users based on twitter sentiment analysis of any live activity (disaster) going 	   on near them.
  6)	#We may also try to make this usable without the internet connection.
  
  EXPLANATION:
 - Predict magnitude of earthquake using Swarm Optimization from Seismological Data.   
 - To build a model to predict monsoon flood (1 day ahead) using Wavelet Transform, Genetic Algorithm, Artificial neural net 
   from Hydrological time series data. 
 - Twitter as a data source has gained lot of prominence in recent years. It is ranked as one of the top 10 popular 
   websites, having 400 million registered users and over 500 million tweets generated every day. Additionally, information about disasters      
   can be extracted from news channels & blogs through APIs, RSS feed or web scraping.
   Sentiment Analysis, Stock Market, Public Health, General public mood and finding political alignments, are some of the areas where
   twitter data have been used.
   
   Some of the advantages of tweets are 	
 - Though it is unstructured,  it has some structure by the limitation of 140 characters.
 - It can use hashtags, which gives semantic annotations of the tweets. 
 - The tweets have geocodes, which can help us spatially map the sources of the tweets. 
  

	OVERVIEW
	This will help the people to prevent the disaster or in the worst case make them aware of a disaster.
