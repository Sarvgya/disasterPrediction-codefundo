# disasterPrediction-codefundo

AIM
To build a technology that will help to prevent and predict the impact of Natural disasters like Earthquakes and Floods (These two areas will be our primary concern).

IDEA
We will try to make an App using Android Studio which will work in colloboration with Machine Learning to make people aware of the disasters in the near future.
This will work in the following way:-
  1)	The App will detect the user's current Location.
  2)	Using this information we can get useful DATA from the various databases available.
  3)	The Data will include the following things:-
		   - It's past records on any disasters (Earthquakes and Floods).
		   - Satelliter Imaging of that particular location.
  4)	Using various ML algorthims we will try to predict the disaster and notify the users.
  5)	For more accuracy we will provide a warning to the users based on twitter sentiment analysis of any live activity (disaster) going 	   on near them.
  6)	#We may also try to make this usable without the internet connection.

	OVERVIEW
	This will help the people to prevent the disaster or in the worst case make them aware of a disaster.
